# Gatys_Style_Transfer_in_PyTorch
Performs style transfer between a content image and a style image as outlined in Gatys et al. (2016)

The script can be used from command line (Python Gatys_Style_Transfer.py). Just make sure to give the complete path to the image files when prompted (or just the name if they are in the same working directory).

A set of examples are included in the repository for reference (style_transferred_*.png)

*IMPORTANT* If you run this from the command line make sure you close the intermediate images as they pop up or the program won't continue until you do (Theese images are displayed to show how the target image chnages style as total loss decrases)
