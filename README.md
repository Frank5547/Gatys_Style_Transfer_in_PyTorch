# Gatys_Style_Transfer_in_PyTorch
Performs style transfer between a content image and a style image as outlined in Gatys et al. (2016)

The script can be used from command line (Python Gatys_Style_Transfer.py). Just make sure to give the complete path to the image files when prompted (or just the name if they are in the same working directory).

A set of examples are included in the repository for reference (style_transferred_*.png)
